        <h1>Privacy Policy for Sota Public VPN</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 10, 2025</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to <strong>Sota Public VPN</strong>. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to ensuring that our app respects your personal data and privacy. This document outlines the type of data we handle, how we process it, and your rights regarding your privacy.</p>

        <h2>Core Functionality of Sota Public VPN</h2>
        <p>Sota Public VPN is designed to provide users with access to a list of free public VPN servers and enable secure connections through established protocols. We prioritize your security and do not collect, store, or share any personal or sensitive user data.</p>

        <h2>Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>Sota Public VPN does not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Collect or store <strong>personal information</strong> (e.g., name, email address, phone number).</li>
            <li>Monitor, log, or store users' online activity, including browsing history, websites visited, or connection logs.</li>
            <li>Collect IP addresses, device information, or geolocation data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This ensures that your activities while using our app remain completely private.</p>

        <h2>Server-Provided Data</h2>
        <p>The VPN server list provided by Sota Public VPN:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Is sourced from public, freely available VPN resources.</li>
            <li>Is dynamically updated on the server-side without any interaction with user data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The app functions solely as an intermediary to allow secure connections to these public VPN servers. No user-specific data is transmitted to or stored on our servers.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Sota Public VPN does not integrate with or share data with third-party services, advertising networks, or analytics providers. Since we do not collect any data, there is no data to share with third parties.</p>

        <h2>Google Play Policies Compliance</h2>
        <p>In line with <strong>Google Play Policies</strong>, we ensure the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not collect or share <strong>personally identifiable information (PII)</strong>.</li>
            <li>We do not process any sensitive user data as defined by Google Play's User Data Policy.</li>
            <li>The app adheres to the principle of <strong>data minimization</strong>, collecting and processing only what is strictly necessary for its core functionalityâ€” in this case, nothing.</li>
        </ul>
